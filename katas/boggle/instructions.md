## Boggle Rules

    Boggle is a game that consists of a 4x4 grid of letters. The purpose of the game is to find words within this 4x4 square.
    Words should be created by using adjoining letters – the letters must touch each other – and must be able to connect to
    each other in the proper sequence to spell the word correctly. The letters may join in any direction – horizontally,
    vertically, or diagonally. This means that the letters can be above or below, side by side, or touching corners.
    Words can be spelled in any direction, including backwards. You may not use a letter cube multiple times in a single word.

## Question

    Ignoring a dictionary, write a function that given a boggle board and a word returns true if the word is in the board, and false if it is not.
